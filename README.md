## üîß Requirements

| Tool / Library | Version tested | Notes                             |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------------------------|
| **g++ / clang++** | ‚â• C++17      | build the three demo programs      |
| **LaTeX** (TeX Live) | 2023       | compile the paper from source      |
| *(optional)* `make` | ‚Äî           | convenient Makefiles are included  |

No external Bayesian-network library is required: the BN demo enumerates the four possible worlds directly.

## üöÄ Quick start

```bash
# 1. clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/<your-user>/classic-puzzle-ai-study.git
cd classic-puzzle-ai-study

# 2. build & run the 8-puzzle A* demo
cd code/a_star_8_puzzle
g++ -std=c++17 a_star_8puzzle.cpp -o eight
./eight        # should print "Solution found with cost = 31 moves."

# 3. build & run the Sudoku CSP demo
cd ../sudoku_csp
g++ -std=c++17 sudoku_csp.cpp -o sudoku
./sudoku       # prints solved grid

# 4. build & run the Bayesian ‚Äúcups‚Äù demo
cd ../bayes_cups
g++ -std=c++17 bayes_cups.cpp -o cups
./cups         # prints P(Cup1)=0, P(Cup2)=1

# 5. view the PDF
xdg-open ../paper/paper.pdf   # or open it manually
